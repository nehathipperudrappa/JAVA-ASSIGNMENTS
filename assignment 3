2] Difference between final, finally and finalize.
solution:
        final:
             a] Definition :	final is the keyword and access modifier which is used to apply restrictions on a class, method or variable.
             b]Applicable : to	Final keyword is used with the classes, methods and variables.
             c]Functionality:	(1) Once declared, final variable becomes constant and cannot be modified.
                              (2) final method cannot be overridden by sub class.
                              (3) final class cannot be inherited.
             d]Execution	:Final method is executed only when we call it.                 
                          
         finally:
             a] Definition :finally is the block in Java Exception Handling to execute the important code whether the exception occurs or not.
             b]Applicable :Finally block is always related to the try and catch block in exception handling.
             c]Functionality:(1) finally block runs the important code even if exception occurs or not.
                             (2) finally block cleans up all the resources used in try block.
             d]Execution	:Finally block is executed as soon as the try-catch block is executed.It's execution is not dependant on the exception. 
          
         finalize:
             a]Definition :finalize is the method in Java which is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
             b]Applicable :finalize() method is used with the objects.
             c]Functionality:finalize method performs the cleaning activities with respect to the object before its destruction.
             d]Execution	:finalize method is executed just before the object is destroyed.
